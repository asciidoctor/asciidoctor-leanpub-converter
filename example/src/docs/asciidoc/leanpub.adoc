[dedication]
== Dedication

This sample book is dedicated to all those people who have contributed to making the Asciidoctor so awesome.

[preface]
== Preface

Asciidoctor is a powerful authoring ecosyetm. Leanpub is a wonderful empoweringm self-publishing platform.
We can combine the two to be even more awesome.

[[QuoteInPreface]]
[quote,Dan Allan]
____
What's interesting is that it opens up the door to using Leanpub purely as a publishing tool...in other words,
a typesetting + delivery tool. The power of Leanpub becomes our power.

= Part One

[partintro]
It is easy to author a multi-part book. Introductory text can be added to parts using the `[partintro]` block.

[chapter]
== Blocks

If you would have read from the beginning you would have already discovered the <<QuoteInPreface,first quote block used in the preface>>.
At the time of writing of standard blocks are supported with the exception of the following:

* `[example]`
* `[stem]`

Titles are supported on all blocks too.

.A literal block
....
Literal text in a block
is reproduced as is
....

.A sidebar
****
I do like the way sidebars are done.
Don't you think it look's great?

=== Source Code

Source code is well supported, but the `source-highligher` attribute will be ignored as syntax highligting is
handled by Leanpub directly using `Pygments`.

[source,groovy]
----
documentBinder {

    setDocuments '/path/to/doc', new File('/path/to/other/doc')

    documents '/path/to/doc', new File(' / path / to / other / doc ')

    documents project.file('add/other/doc')

    documents { '/even/add/from/closure' }
}
----

Leanpub does not support callouts in source code, therefore the conversion process takes car of this by adding
 line numbers and adding a `colist` block with line number references.

.Source code with paragraph style
[source,groovy]
----
documentBinder {

    setDocuments '/path/to/doc', new File('/path/to/other/doc') // <1>

    documents '/path/to/doc', new File(' / path / to / other / doc ') // <2>

    documents project.file('add/other/doc')

    documents { '/even/add/from/closure' } // <3>
}
----
<1> Clear any existing document list, and replace with the given list. List can contain anything that `project.files`
     can convert to `File` objects.
<2> Append more documents to existing list
<3> Even closures can be used to allow for late evaluation of documents

The `colist` layout can be controlled via controlled via two attributes:

* `leanpub-colist-style` : The default style is `paragraph`, but `aside` and `discussion` are valid styles too.
* `leanpub-colist-prefix` : BY default this is is *Line*, but if youw prefer something else, for instance because the
  book is another language then just override it.

:leanpub_colist_style: aside

.Source code with aside style
[source,groovy]
----
documentBinder {

    documents project.file('add/other/doc')

    documents { '/even/add/from/closure' } // <3>
}

     can convert to `File` objects.

[source,groovy]
