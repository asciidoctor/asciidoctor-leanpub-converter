= Asciidoctor Leanpub Converter

Very early stages to showing a converter written in Groovy using the experimental
asciidoctorj-1.6.0 branch


== Building

```
git clone https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctorj.git -b asciidoctorj-1.6.0
cd asciidoctorj
vi gradle.properties
```

Change the version to `1.6.0-SNAPSHOT`. It is still set as `1.5.3-SNAPSHOT`, but let's avoid confusion with another
`asciidoctorj` development branch. Save your change, then do

```
cd asciidoctorj-core
../gradlew -i build publishToMavenLocal
```

Now you are ready to clone and build this

```
cd ../../
git clone https://github.com/ysb33r/asciidoctor-leanpub-converter.git
cd asciidoctor-leanpub-converter/core
./gradlew build install
```

== Notes
Level 0 heading becomes a Leanpub part and creates a new part file

```
= This becomes a part
```

Level 1 heading becomes a Leanpub chapter. In addition if it is annotated with `[chapter]` it creates a new chapter file


```
[chapter]
== This becomes a chapter
```

Level 1 heading annotated with `[preface]` becomes a Leanpub preface

```
[preface]
== This is a preface
```

Poetry blocks are supported by adding a `poem` role to a literal block

```
[role="poem"]
....
Poem goes here
....
```
