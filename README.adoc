= Asciidoctor Leanpub Converter

Very early stages to showing a converter written in Groovy using the experimental
asciidoctorj-1.6.0 branch


== Building

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctorj.git -b asciidoctorj-1.6.0
cd asciidoctorj
vi gradle.properties
----

Change the version to `1.6.0-SNAPSHOT`. It is still set as `1.5.3-SNAPSHOT`, but let's avoid confusion with another
`asciidoctorj` development branch. Save your change, then do

[source,bash]
----
cd asciidoctorj-core
../gradlew -i build publishToMavenLocal
cd ../asciidoctorj-distribution
../gradlew -i build
----

Now you are ready to clone and build this

[source,bash]
----
cd ../../
git clone https://github.com/ysb33r/asciidoctor-leanpub-converter.git
cd asciidoctor-leanpub-converter/core
./gradlew build install
----

== Using your snapshot build

If you are using Asciidoctor plugin for Gradle then you should be able to do

[source,groovy]
----
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenLocal()
        jcenter()
    }

    dependencies {
        classpath 'org.asciidoctor:asciidoctor-gradle-plugin:1.5.2'
        classpath 'asciidoctor-leanpub:asciidoctor-leanpub-core:0.1-SNAPSHOT'
    }
}

apply plugin : 'org.asciidoctor.gradle.asciidoctor'

repositories {
    jcenter()
    mavenLocal()
}

asciidoctorj {
   version = '1.6.0-SNAPSHOT'
}

asciidoctor {
  backends 'leanpub'
}
----

If you want to try the command-line version of asciidoctorj, then you are in luck. You can run it from
 `asciidoctorj/asciidoctorj-distribution/build/install/asciidoctorj-distribution/bin/asciidoctorj`. All you have to do is
 pass the `--cp` command-line parameter and tell it where the leanpub-converter-core.jar is.

== Parts & Chapters

Level 0 heading becomes a Leanpub part and creates a new part file

```
= This becomes a part
```

Level 1 heading becomes a Leanpub chapter. In addition if it is annotated with `[chapter]` it creates a new chapter file.
At least one level 1 heading should be annotated with `[chapter]`.
When writing a multi-part book, ensure that level 1 headings that follow a level 0, are annotated wth '
`[chapter]`, otherwise they will disappear from the Leanpub output.


```
[chapter]
== This becomes a chapter
```

Level 1 heading annotated with `[preface]` becomes a Leanpub preface

```
[preface]
== This is a preface
```

Leanpub allows chapters to be added to a sample book. If you want chapters or a preface to be added to your sample book,
add `leanpub='sample'` metadata to the chapter or preface block

```
[preface,leanpub='sample']
== Preface

[chapter,leanpub='sample']
== Chapter
```
== Blocks

Poetry blocks are supported by adding a `poem` role to a verse block

```
[verse.poem]
....
Poem goes here
....
```

== Source code blocks with callouts

Leanpub does not support callputs in the way Asciidoctor does. Our solution, for when callouts are detected, is to
generate a source code listing with line numbers. THe associated *colist* block is then generated with corresponding
line numbers instead of the original callout numbers. The callouts are also removed from the source listing.

Currently it is possible to generate the *colist* block in one of three styles, which in themselves correspond to
Leanpub blocks. They are:

* *paragraph* (default)
* *aside*
* *discussion*

The specific style is set via the `leanpub-colist-style` attribute. Each *colist* item is preceded by a prefix of `Line`.
This can be changed by setting the `leanpub-colist-prefix` attribute.

== Cover page

Use `:front-cover-page: image:NameOfImage.png[]` to add a Leanpub cover. Currently no size checking is done, but a
PNG extension is required. See https://leanpub.com/help/manual#leanpub-auto-how-to-insert-cover-images--cover-pages(Leanpub docs)
for more detail on size requirements.
